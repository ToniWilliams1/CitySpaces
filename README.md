## Core Features
Users will either create an account using an email address and password, or log in to the app via Google account where they can filter through 600+ volunteer opportunities across categories such as health, education, strengthening communities, and environment. <br>

Users can save the events they would like to attend, and mark the ones they've attended as "complete". <br>

Once marked complete, the user can faciliate a reflection discussion about the project they completed. Other users may hone in on the conversation by commenting and liking posts.
