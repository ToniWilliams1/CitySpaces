## Core Features <br>

Our innovative app makes it easy for users to discover and participate in volunteer opportunities across a wide range of categories, including health, education, strengthening communities, and the environment. Whether creating a new account or logging in via Google, users can quickly filter through 600+ events to find the perfect match for their interests and skills. <br>

 With the ability to save and track their progress through events, users can easily stay organized and engaged, ensuring they never miss an opportunity to make a difference in their community. And once an event is marked as "complete," users can facilitate a reflection discussion about the project they completed, allowing them to share their experiences and insights with others.<br>

 Our app's unique social features, including the ability to comment and like posts, create a dynamic and engaging community of users who share a passion for volunteerism and social impact. And with robust search and filtering options, users can easily find and connect with like-minded individuals who share their interests and goals. <br>
